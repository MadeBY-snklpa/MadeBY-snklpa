 
**Hi there! ðŸ‘‹**

*I'm Sankalpa silva â€” an Infrastructure and Security Consultant with hands-on experience in Azure cloud, networking, and architecture.

I design and implement secure, scalable, and high-performance infrastructure solutions that help organizations operate efficiently and safely in the cloud. My focus areas include cloud security, identity management, network design, infrastructure automation, and governance across enterprise environments.

I enjoy solving complex technical challenges, optimizing systems for reliability and performance, and ensuring that every solution aligns with security best practices. Over time, Iâ€™ve worked with tools and technologies such as Azure Security Center, Azure Networking, Azure Firewall, Bicep, and Microsoft Defender for Cloud. 

Iâ€™m constantly learning and exploring new ways to strengthen cloud environments, automate deployments, and enhance overall security posture. Outside of work, I use this space to share ideas, labs, and projects that reflect my ongoing journey in cloud architecture and cybersecurity.

Thanks for visiting my profile â€” feel free to explore my repositories or connect to discuss all things cloud, security, and infrastructure.*
